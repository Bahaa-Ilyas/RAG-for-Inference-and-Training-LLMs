"""Build and persist a local teaching index.

Method: RAPTOR / hierarchical retrieval

RAPTOR recursively clusters chunks and summarizes them into a tree so retrieval can search both granular passages and higher-level summaries.

This numbered file follows the cookbook style used by the reference tutorial:
each script does one small job and prints inspectable JSON.
