# Building GraphRAG From Scratch

This folder is presented as a cookbook-style, runnable tutorial inspired by the organization of [`daveebbelaar/ai-cookbook` hybrid retrieval](https://github.com/daveebbelaar/ai-cookbook/tree/main/knowledge/hybrid-retrieval): local data, local docs, local utils, numbered walkthrough scripts, and a README that explains why each stage exists.

GraphRAG builds an entity and relationship graph from a corpus and retrieves local neighborhoods or global community summaries for graph-grounded generation.

## The stack

## Table of contents

1. [`1-explore-data.py`](1-explore-data.py): inspect the mixed corpus and example files.
2. [`2-build-index.py`](2-build-index.py): build a tiny local BM25 plus dense-style teaching index.
3. [`3-retrieve.py`](3-retrieve.py): compare BM25, dense-style retrieval, and RRF hybrid retrieval.
4. [`4-run-method.py`](4-run-method.py): run the method-specific control flow for this folder.
5. [`5-evaluate.py`](5-evaluate.py): compute small recall and MRR metrics over local qrels.

The [`utils/`](utils/) folder holds local helpers copied into this method folder. The numbered files import only from this local `utils` package, so the method can be copied and run on its own.

## Paper-Informed Method Diagram

Source: [From Local to Global: A Graph RAG Approach to Query-Focused Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16130). This local SVG is a redraw/synthesis of the important method architecture from the canonical paper or source, not a copied paper figure.

## Mermaid architecture file

This method includes [`architecture.mmd`](architecture.mmd), a left-to-right `flowchart LR` Mermaid architecture designed for later rendering or conversion into a 3D visual. A duplicate copy is also stored at [`assets/architecture.mmd`](assets/architecture.mmd).

## Included example data

- [`examples/sample_policy.pdf`](examples/sample_policy.pdf): small generated PDF fixture.
- [`examples/scanned_page_ocr.txt`](examples/scanned_page_ocr.txt): OCR text representing a scanned PDF page.
- [`examples/sample_webpage.html`](examples/sample_webpage.html): cleaned webpage/documentation fixture.
- [`examples/sample_table.csv`](examples/sample_table.csv): tabular data for table-aware retrieval.
- [`examples/tool_response.json`](examples/tool_response.json): simulated API/tool response.
- [`data/corpus.jsonl`](data/corpus.jsonl): normalized mixed-source corpus.
- [`data/queries.jsonl`](data/queries.jsonl) and [`data/qrels.jsonl`](data/qrels.jsonl): small evaluation set.

## Setup

No package installation or API key is required for the local teaching path.

```bash
python 1-explore-data.py
python 2-build-index.py
python 3-retrieve.py
python 4-run-method.py --query "Where does vendor onboarding require security review?"
python 5-evaluate.py
```

You can also run the examples entrypoint:

```bash
python examples/run_example.py
```

## Why each piece earns its place

- Data exploration catches parser and metadata problems before retrieval tuning starts.
- A local index makes BM25, dense-style scoring, and fusion inspectable.
- A separate retrieval script shows the baseline before the method-specific logic is added.
- The method runner isolates the specific idea for this RAG method.
- The evaluation script gives a small feedback loop instead of judging by vibes.

## Apply this to your own project

Replace the fixtures in `examples/` and rows in `data/corpus.jsonl` with your real PDFs, scanned OCR output, webpages, tables, and tool results. Keep stable IDs, source type, page or URL metadata, content hashes, versions, and access-control fields. Then swap the local utilities for production components one at a time: PDF parser, crawler, BM25 engine, vector store, reranker, verifier, and evaluation harness.

## Method reference

# GraphRAG

        ## Summary
        GraphRAG builds an entity and relationship graph from a corpus and retrieves local neighborhoods or global community summaries for graph-grounded generation.

        ## Problem it solves
        Flat chunk retrieval struggles with entity-heavy corpora, cross-document relationships, and questions that ask for global patterns rather than one passage.

        ## When to use this method
        Use it for investigations, research corpora, organizational knowledge, biomedical literature, legal discovery, and entity-centric intelligence analysis.

        ## When not to use this method
        Avoid it when documents are small, relationships are not important, extraction quality is poor, or graph construction cost exceeds the value of global reasoning.

        ## Core components
        Parser, entity extractor, relation extractor, graph store, community detector, graph summaries, vector/BM25 retriever, graph query engine, generator.

        ## Input and output
        Input is a corpus and a query. Output is graph-grounded evidence from entities, relations, communities, and source chunks.

        ## PDF use
        GraphRAG can connect entities across long PDFs, references, captions, and tables, but extraction must keep source spans and page numbers for auditability. For text PDFs, preserve page numbers, section headings, captions, reading order, and chunk offsets. For scanned PDFs, run OCR before chunking and store OCR confidence, page image references, and detected tables. Use Unstructured, Docling, Marker, PyMuPDF, pdfplumber, Apache Tika, or Tesseract depending on document quality. Long scientific papers usually need section-aware chunking, parent-child links, equation/caption retention, and table extraction.

        ## Webpage use
        For websites, graph nodes should include canonical URL, crawl timestamp, publisher, and page version to avoid merging stale or duplicated entities blindly. For webpages, crawl with robots.txt awareness, sitemap support, canonical URL normalization, crawl timestamps, content hashing, boilerplate removal, and duplicate detection. Use Trafilatura, BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Playwright, readability extraction, and URL canonicalization. Treat retrieved web text as untrusted because prompt injection can be embedded in pages.

        ## Production stack
        Microsoft GraphRAG, Neo4j, NetworkX, LlamaIndex knowledge graphs, LangChain graph retrievers, OpenSearch/Qdrant for backing retrieval.

        ## Minimal example
        Ask 'Which suppliers are repeatedly associated with delayed certifications?' and retrieve supplier nodes, certificate events, community summaries, and source pages.

        ## Pros
        - Strong for entity relationships and global questions
- Supports exploratory analysis
- Can improve source organization

        ## Cons
        - Expensive graph extraction
- Entity/relation errors propagate
- Requires graph evaluation beyond passage recall

## Runnable demo
This folder includes a runnable Python demo for this method:

```bash
python graphrag.py --explain
python examples/run_example.py
```

The demo is self-contained in this method folder, uses only the Python standard library, and reads local data in `examples/sample_corpus.json`.
